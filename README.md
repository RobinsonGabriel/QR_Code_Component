### What I learned

Probably the biggest think I went over was centering the element. The rest of it was really just reviewing what the particular names were for particular things. 

.grid-container{
    @media(min-width: 15em){
        width: 10em;
    }
    background-color: white;
    padding: 1em;
    border-radius: 1em;
    box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px black;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

}

^^Took a few hours because I wasn't aware that flexbox and grid, while they can be complimentary, have their own commands and they were overriding eachother a bunch. I still feel this was a bit verbose for my liking, but otherwise I am just happy it looked like something.

### Continued development

The main point I'm working with this is to get more comfortable with doing front end work. There's a non-zero chance I'll need to do it/help someone learn it and I would prefer to not embarass myself. Probably the biggest thing I want to work with more is CSS's flexbox and grid formats. Partly because they have similar rules to Tkinter and I struggle with layout there too.
